# advent-of-code 
My Advent of Code Solutions for all years, solved using the Rust programming language.

## Running
All solutions are built using rust so you need to have rust and cargo installed. Then run:

```
cargo run --release
```

To run a specific year, day or input file use the ```--year```, ```--day``` and ```--input``` flags:

```
cargo run --release -- --year 2018 --day 12 --input myfile.txt
```
