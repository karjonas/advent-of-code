# advent-of-code 
My Advent of Code Solutions for all years, solved using the Rust programming language.

## Running
All solutions are built using rust so you need to have rust and cargo installed. Then run:

```
cargo run --release
```

To run a specific year and day use the ```--year``` and ```--day``` flags:

```
cargo run --release -- --year 2018 --day 12
```
